= Goals =

Here are my goals (perhaps even in descending importance to me):
  * Standard C++ implementation of MGA
  * Cross platform (Win32, OSX, Linux)
  * High-performance while also memory efficient
  * Rationalize 10+ year old code base (i.e. refactor)
  * Python bindings for use in web services
